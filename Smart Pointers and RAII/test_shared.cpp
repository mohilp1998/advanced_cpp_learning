/***************** PROBLEM STATEMENT *****************/
/*
You are designing a small system to track library books.
Each book is represented by a Book class. Multiple readers can borrow (share) the same book at the same time.
Requirements:
  - Define a Book class with:
    - a title (string)
    - a constructor and destructor (print messages when they are called).
    - a method read() that prints "Reading <title>".

  - Use std::shared_ptr<Book> to:
    - Create a new book ("C++ Primer").
    - Create multiple readers (reader1, reader2, â€¦) sharing the same book.
    - Print the reference count (use_count()) after each reader borrows the book.
    - Have one reader give up the book (reset), and print the reference count again.

  - When the last shared_ptr is destroyed, the book should be automatically deleted.

  // Adding one more reference
